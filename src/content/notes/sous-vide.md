Most of these measurements come directly from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/techniques-5118032). I am not doing a writeup on the why's or any specific recipe as J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's research on sous-vide is comprehensive and worth pouring over at the link above. This page just capturing my most common cooking combinations as a quick-reference.
