Double boiling is the act of gently heating an ingredient indirectly with boiling water. This technique allows for the the gradual raising of temperature where over-heating would cause problems for the cook. It is most often used for melting chocolate but it has other applications.

## Tools needed

- 3 or 4 quart pot
- 1 heat-resistant bowl, slightly wider than the rim of the pot
- 1 oven mit or vice-grip pliers
- Instant-read or other probe-style thermometer specific temperature is needed.

## Instructions

1. Fill the pot with 1-2 inches of water then heat on high.
2. Place chocolate, marscapone, or whatever needs heated into the metal bowl.
3. If using vice-grips, affix them to the rim of the bowl. Using an oven mit works too but I much prefer the control that the pliers afford. Steam will vent from around the bowl and will quickly burn unprotected skin.
4. When the water starts boiling, rest the bowl on top of the pot.
5. Stir gently and test with thermometer as required.
