## Ingredients [^salt]

- 4 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp corn starch
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1 tsp oregano (mexican oregano if convenient)
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients.

[^salt]: I usually forget whether or not I put salt in a spice blend. I have taken to purposefully omitting it from my blends so I do not have to worry about over-salting. When cooking, add salt to personal preference.
