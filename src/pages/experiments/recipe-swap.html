<p><a href="https://recipe-swap.herokuapp.com/">RecipeSwap</a> allows users to browse, curate, and spin off recipes. Pinterest and browser bookmarks are lovely way to curate recipes from online locations but they have one serious drawback. There is no way to tweak that recipe. Whether your an onion lover, vegan, fan of fusion, or just seriously opinionated about flavors, this tool will allow you to tweak the recipes you curate to meet your own personal preferences.</p>

<h2>With RecipeSwap you are be able to</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Browse the communitiy's recipes.</li>
  <li>Publish you own recipes to share with the RecipeSwap community.</li>
  <li>Mark recipes as favorites for easy reference.</li>
  <li>Spin off recipes to make them your own.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Though there are no password complexity requirements baked in, I would still suggest using a complex password.</li>
  <li>The app collects the emails but does not do anything with them.</li>
  <li>It doesn’t have an import function (yet)- I’m still exploring options...</li>
  <li>It sometimes takes a few moments to load - especially if the app hasn’t been visited in several hours.</li>
  <li>It’s in its infancy so is prone to downtime/ heavy modifications.</li>
  <li>I will be re-writing it based off of feedback I get back.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Geekery</h2>
<p><a href="https://recipe-swap.herokuapp.com/">RecipeSwap</a> is a project that I built during my software engineering course with Flatiron. It is built in Ruby using Sinatra and ActiveRecord.</p>
