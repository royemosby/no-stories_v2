  <h2>Recipe stories can be tedious</h2>
  <p>
    This site dispenses with storytime and is an uncluttered reference for the
    kitchen. It was was designed to work marvelously with mobile devices since
    they are the new cookbooks.
  </p>

  <h2>About me</h2>

  <p>
    I was born in the late 70's but self-identify as an elder millennial.
    Married, 1 kid, cats. <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/sunday-review/please-dont-thank-me-for-my-service.html"
      >Military retiree</a
    >. I'm a fan of flat caps and cast iron. I'm highly inspired by the cuisines
    we experienced while we traveled abroad. Cucina povera of southern Italy,
    germanic dishes, and hungarian foods all have a special place in my heart.
  </p>

  <h2>Not a profit-driven site</h2>

  <p>
    Hosting is cheap these days so this site is a toy project. No one is paying
    for this site other than myself. Links or brands that appear on this site
    only because of a personal preference. If any of this were ever to change,
    it will be noted here.
  </p>

  <h2>Geekery</h2>

  <p>
    I am using <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> to build this site and hosting
    on Netlify. For those who are curious, you can see the site's Github repo here:
    <a href="https://github.com/royemosby/no-stories">royemosby/no-stories</a>.

  <h2>A note on copyright law regarding recipes</h2>

  <p>
    U.S. Copyright office maintains that plain recipes (list of ingredients and
    instructions) cannot be covered by copyright. See <a
      href="https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ33.pdf">Circular 33 (PDF)</a
    > for more details. Some of the recipes on this site are inspired by those that
    I have found in books or on other sites. In the spirit of gratitude, I have provided
    a reference to the original source wherever possible.
