## Ingredients

- 2 large or 3-4 medium tomatoes
- 6 jalapeños
- 6 chiles de arbol
- 2 cloves garlic
- salt (to flavor)

## Hardware

- cookie sheet or 9" by 13" casserole dish
- parchment paper or aluminum foil as a liner
- blender or food processor

## Instructions

1. Place top oven rack on highest notch and preheat broiler at 500F.
2. Prepare vegetables:
   1. Tomatoes: remove stems and slice in quarters (half if using smaller tomatoes)
   2. Jalapenos: Remove tops. Split in half lengthwise and remove seeds.
   3. Chiles: remove tops.
   4. Garlic: remove skin and keep intact.
3. Place all vegetables onto a lined cookie sheet or casserole dish, skin-side up.
4. Put into oven on top rack for 5 minutes. The garlic will cook much faster and will need to be removed earlier than the tomatoes. Garlic gets bitter when allowed to blacken excessively.
5. Keep an eye on the tray and pull when skin blisters and starts to blacken in places- approximately 10% of the surface area across the tomatoes and chiles.
6. Place all vegetables into a blender and pulse for 2-3 seconds * 5 times.
7. Add salt to preference, pulsing blender to disperse evenly.
8. Serve hot or use within a week with refrigeration.
